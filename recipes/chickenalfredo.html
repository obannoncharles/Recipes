    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        Fettuccine Alfredo or fettuccine al burro is an Italian pasta dish 
        of fresh fettuccine tossed with butter and Parmesan. 
        As the cheese melts, it emulsifies the liquids to form a 
        smooth and rich cheese sauce coating the pasta.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Alfredo Sauce</li>
        <li>Noodles</li>
        <li>Seasonings</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recipe</h3>
   
    <ul>
        <li>
            Boil the noodles: Cook the Fettuccine al dente, 
            according to package instructions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the chicken: Season the chicken, then pan-fry in oil and butter, 
            for 6 minutes a side, or until an internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. 
            Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for a few minutes, 
            then cut into 1/2-inch thick slices. 
            Tent with foil, while you prepare the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the Alfredo sauce: Using the same pan you used to cook the chicken, 
            the cream, butter, and seasonings are incorporated and simmered on medium-low heat until thickened, 
            then the Parmesan is added in until melted and smooth. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble: Drain the pasta, reserving some of the liquid to loosen the sauce (only if necessary.) 
            Toss immediately with the Alfredo sauce. Divide the pasta among serving bowls and 
            top with a few slices of cooked chicken. 
            Garnish with parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.
    </ul>
