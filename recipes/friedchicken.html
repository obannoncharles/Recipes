    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Fried chicken, also known as Southern fried chicken, 
        is a dish consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated with seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried, 
        deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried. 
        The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior 
        of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   
        <ul>
            <li>3 Eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups Flour</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Salt</li>
            <li>2 tsp Pepper</li>

                In a large bowl, beat the eggs. In another bowl, combine the salt, pepper, garlic powder and 
                paprika to make a seasoned salt. Add the flour to a third bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare the chicken by first seasoning each piece of chicken to your taste with the seasoned salt. 
                Then dip each piece in the egg and drag through flour until coated well.
            </li>
            <li>
